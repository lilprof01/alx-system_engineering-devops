Added Components and Justifications
Firewalls:
To control and restrict network traffic.
Also to prevent unauthorized access to internal servers.

SSL Certificate:
Ensures traffic between users and the servers is encrypted.
Protects data from being intercepted (middle-man attacks).

Monitoring Clients:
Track server health, resource usage, traffic, and error rates.
Send data to a centralized monitoring service (e.g., Sumologic, Datadog, or Prometheus).

Why these features are Added
1. Firewalls:
To protect internal resources by limiting access based on IP addresses, ports, and protocols.
Block malicious traffic such as DDoS attacks or unauthorized scans.
2. HTTPS (SSL Certificate):
Encrypts traffic, ensuring sensitive user information (like login credentials) isn’t exposed.
Boosts user trust and complies with modern security standards.
3. Monitoring:
Tracks the performance of infrastructure and detects issues proactively.
Helps identify trends, such as increased QPS (Queries Per Second), so scaling decisions can be made.
Sends metrics/logs to a centralized monitoring service for real-time alerts.
Monitoring Tools and QPS Monitoring
How Data Collection Works:

Monitoring QPS:
For Web Servers:
Nginx logs QPS (via access logs).
Monitors using tools like Logstash or Nginx’s built-in status module.
For Load Balancers:
Tracks requests handled by HAProxy using its statistics module or exported logs.


ISSUES with the infrastructure:
Terminating SSL at the Load Balancer:
Problem:
Traffic between the load balancer and internal servers is unencrypted and this can be exploited if the internal network is breached.

Single MySQL Server for Writes:
Problem:
If the primary MySQL server fails, write operations stop and this can lead to risk of data loss or downtime.

Servers with All Components (Monolithic Servers):
Problem:
A failure in one server impacts all components (web, app, and database).
Scaling becomes inefficient, as we must replicate all components unnecessarily.
